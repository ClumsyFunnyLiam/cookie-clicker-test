im having an issue with the code,
it makes a duplitcate of the upgrades every ten seconds once uplocked instead of just making one.
it also makes duplicates once you buy a building, it doesnt matter wehich one.

it has something to do with updateUpgrades();
im also new to javascript and dot know what to search up.
